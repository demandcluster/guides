# Welcome to the Charluv Documentation Site.

Charluv, or Agnai for short, is both an open-source project and a website. Put simply, Agnai lets you create chat bots using LLMs (see "**[What is a LLM?](/docs/what-is-an-llm)**"). While Agnai does offer both free and paid LLMs, some users prefer to host their own (see "**[Configuring your AI service](/docs/configuring-ai-services)**". Some users prefer Kobold Horde while others use OpenAI, OpenRouter, Replicate, NovelAI, or even their own hardware (see "**[Self-hosting an LLM](/docs/self-hosting-an-llm)**". Being both an open-source project and supporting multiple language models from various locations helps ensure your Agnai chat bots will stick around and work the way you want them to work -- not the way someone tells you they should work.

Our hope is that this documentation site and the supporting videos turn the learning curve into an exciting journey as you craft intelligent, interactive bots. These docs are here as a resource to the community and will be improved over time in an effort to provide smooth navigation of Charluv nuances for compelling bot interactions.

Beyond just talking to chat bots, Agnai provides an engaging **[Discord server](https://agnai.chat/discord)** with a vibrant and colorful community. Come meet friends, get support, and hang out with us!
