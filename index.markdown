# Welcome to the Charluv Documentation Site.

Charluv, is both an open-source project (based on the Agnai project) and a website. Put simply, Charluv lets you create chat bots using LLMs (see "**[What is a LLM?](/docs/what-is-an-llm)**").

Our hope is that this documentation site and the supporting videos turn the learning curve into an exciting journey as you craft intelligent, interactive bots. These docs are here as a resource to the community and will be improved over time in an effort to provide smooth navigation of Charluv nuances for compelling bot interactions.

Beyond just talking to chat bots, Charluv provides an engaging **[Discord server](https://charluv.com/discord)** with a vibrant and colorful community. Come meet friends, get support, and hang out with us!
