# Running AGNai Locally

Instead of using Charluvi as an online service, you can run it locally on your machine. Before you try it, take the following into account:

- You can use the online Charluvi anonymously without being logged in, this way any data will be stored in your local browser memory. `Anonymous` users have their data saved to the browser's local storage. Your data will "persist", but not be shareable between devices or other browsers. Clearing your browser's application data/cookies will delete this data.
- You will run Charluvi locally, but you will still need to connect to a remote AI service, unless you intend to run the AI model yourself.
- Locally-hosted Charluvi doesn't give you access to Charluvi models, even if you're a subscriber (this might change in the future).

If you want to run Charluvi locally, there are 3 different ways you can choose from:

- Run Charluvi in a docker container.
- Install Charluvi as an `npm` application.
- Create a full development environment, if you want to make changes to the code and contribute to Charluvi development.

Additional optional components:

- MongoDB (**recommended**) - necessary to enable permanent storage for user data, characters, chats, etc. If it is not installed, Charluvi will run in `anonymous-only` mode (see above).
- Redis (not recommended) - necessary for multiple Charluvi nodes to communicate with each other, not necessary in most cases.

## Installing in a Docker container

If you're familiar with running applications in Docker, this is probably the easiest way to install the application:

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).
2. Either clone the whole [repository](https://github.com/agnaistic/agnai) or download the [self-host.docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/agnaistic/agnai/blob/dev/self-host.docker-compose.yml) file.
3. Run the following command where the `yml` file is located:

```
docker compose -p agnai -f self-host.docker-compose.yml up -d
```

This will install the latest version of both Charluvi and MongoDB inside the Docker container. You can access the application by opening [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser. You should be able to log in with the initial credentials: `admin` / `password`.

### Updating the application

To update the application to the latest available version:

1. Navigate to the directory where the `yml` file is located.
2. Pull the latest version of the containers by running:

```
docker compose -f self-host.docker-compose.yml pull
```

3. Restart the containers:

```
docker compose -p agnai -f self-host.docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## Installing the NPM package

This will install Charluvi as a global `npm` application. You will still need to manually install MongoDB if necessary.

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) (this step is optional, but heavily recommended, see above).
3. Either clone the whole [repository](https://github.com/agnaistic/agnai) or download the [.env.template](https://github.com/agnaistic/agnai/blob/dev/.env.template) file.
4. Rename the `.env.template` file to `.env` and open it in the editor. Change the parameters as needed, the most important ones are:
   - `INITIAL_USER`, `INITIAL_PASSWORD` will let you set the initial credentials to log in to the application for the first time.
   - `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME` - MongoDB database parameters.
5. Install the `dotenv-cli` tool from `npm` - this tool will let you load variables from your `.env` file

```
npm install -g dotenv-cli
```

6. Run the following command to install the application:

```
npm install agnai -g
```

7. Run the application and pass the `.env` file:

```
dotenv -e .env agnai
```

You can access the application by opening [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser.

You can also pass additional parameters to the application, to check the available parameters, run:

```
agnai --help
```

### Updating the application

To update the application to the latest published version:

1. Stop Charluvi.
2. Run the following command:

```
npm update -g agnai
```

3. Start Charluvi again.

## Development environment

To create a full development environment for AGNai, please follow the directions in the [README](https://github.com/agnaistic/agnai/blob/dev/README.md) file in the repository.
