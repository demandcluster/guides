# What is an LLM

LLM, or Large Language Model, forms the foundation of Charluv, acting as the central mechanism that allows creation of chat bots. These advanced models are trained to understand and generate human-like text based on input, thus providing a conversational interface.

Charluv is a tool for building prompts for chat bots. Charluv assembles your chat history, memory book entries, and other features into the context that gets sent to the LLM. For example, by using the 'Robot' chat option on the homepage and filling in the 'Send a message' box just like any other messaging platform, Charluv builds context containing this user input and sends it to the selected LLM service. The LLM service then processes the context, generates the response, and sends the response to Charluv which then presents the esponse to the user.

These LLMs come in a range of choices. Charluv provides both free and paid LLMs and also supports integration of user-hosted and third-party LLMs. There are various popular LLM services that Charluv supports include OpenAI, OpenRouter, Replicate, NovelAI, and others. Users may even opt to self-host their LLMs depending on their specific needs and preferences.

A unique feature of Charluv is its flexibility and adaptability to work with various LLMs. It aims to provide users with the freedom to create chat bots that work the way users want, instead of imposing on our users what a chat bot should be. The variety of LLMs on offer ensures that there is something to suit everyone's tastes, whether one prefers the Kobold Horde or their own custom Self-hosted model.

Do note that when interacting with an LLM, responses can vary. These depend on the complexity of the request, the LLM service being used, and other factors. Also, please take a moment to read through our [AI Safety guide](/docs/ai-safety) so you can better understand the risks involved with using LLMs for various activities.

Remember, the power of LLMs lies in their ability to generate creative, diverse and human-like conversation. So, harness their potential and enjoy your journey into the world of Charluv!
